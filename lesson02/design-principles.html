            <h3>Visual Hierarchy</h3>
            <p>Apple</p>

            <p>Apple's website is a prime example of Visual Hierarchy. They show you what is most important, and what
                they most want you to take action on. At the top of the screen, we see a simple logo, then immediately
                the promotion that they want you to take action on. Followed by the next important urgency scare which
                is their newest release, the iPhone 15 and how to learn more about it, then also buy it. They are
                showing not telling what is most important.</p>

            <h3>PARC: Alignment</h3>
            <p>Open Ai</p>
            <a href="https://openai.com">openai.com</a>
            <img src="images/openAi.PNG" alt="Screen shot of OpenAI's opening website">
            <p>Open AI follows a Z approach to their placement, and a left align for their text. They do this all over
                there website, but it is best shown on their front home page. This takes advantage of the fact that
                people tend to read websites in an F style. As people scan down the left side of the webpage, they will
                see all the content that they want them to see.</p>

            <h3>Fitt's Law</h3>
            <p>Marriot</p>
            <a href="https://www.marriott.com/default.mi">marriott.com</a>
            <img src="images/Marriot.PNG" alt="Screen shot of Marriot's opening website">
            <p>Marriot's website is an excellent example of fitt's law. They make the time it takes to make a
                reservation very quick. Furthermore, they make the proximity of the location information very easy by
                placing it at the top of the website, but not as close as the reserve now button, because that is where
                your finger naturally lies on mobile.</p>
