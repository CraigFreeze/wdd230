            <h2>Ether 12:8</h2>
            <p>But because of the faith of men he has shown himself unto the world, and glorified the name of the
                Father,
                and prepared a way that thereby others might be partakers of the heavenly gift, that they might hope for
                those things which they have not seen.</p>

            <h2>Moroni 10:3</h2>
            <p>Behold, I would exhort you that when ye shall read these things, if it be wisdom in God that ye should
                read
                them, that ye would remember how merciful the Lord hath been unto the children of men, from the creation
                of
                Adam even down until the time that ye shall receive these things, and ponder it in your hearts.</p>
